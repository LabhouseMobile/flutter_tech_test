# Cabina

Podcast player for iOS and Android: search iTunes, browse a show's RSS feed, stream episodes, keep a
library of subscribed shows.

## Stack
- Flutter 3.41.9 pinned with FVM (`.fvmrc`). The SDK and Very Good CLI (1.2.0) are not upgraded:
  ignore the CLI's update prompt.
- Gates run only with `fvm flutter analyze`, `fvm dart format` and `fvm flutter test`.

## Feature anatomy
```
lib/<feature>/
  cubit/ | bloc/   <feature>_cubit.dart or <feature>_bloc.dart, with <feature>_state.dart as a
                   part file (a bloc adds <feature>_event.dart)
  data/            <feature>_repository.dart
    services/      data sources: network, local storage or an SDK
    parsers/       raw payload → model
  models/
  views/           <feature>_page.dart
  widgets/
```

## Layers and DI
- View → Cubit/Bloc → Repository → Service. Widgets never touch a repository or a service.
- App-scoped services, repositories and blocs go in `AppDependencyInjection`. Route-scoped blocs, and
  the repository and services only they use, are created in the page's `route()`.
- Cabina's Page/View split: `static GoRoute route()` provides the bloc and the Page consumes it. No
  separate `XView` class. Every routed page declares `routeName`, `routePath` and `route()`;
  `RouterBuilder` only lists them. A tab (`DiscoverPage`, `LibraryPage`) has no route: `HomePage`
  owns it and builds the tabs.
- Repository and service:
  - A feature that wraps a single SDK or provider declares `abstract interface class
    <Feature>Repository` and the service implements it (`JustAudioPlayerService implements
    PlayerRepository`). The bloc depends on the repository. No pass-through class.
  - A feature whose repository sits over a shared service (discover, search over
    `ItunesSearchService`) or a service + parser (show_detail) uses a concrete repository, even if it
    only forwards today.  
- A feature imports another feature only for its Page, to navigate. Other shared code follows the
  rule of three (Reuse before writing).

## State management
- Cubit by default. Use a Bloc only for (1) `bloc_concurrency` event transformers (see `SearchBloc`)
  or (2) traceability across several event sources, such as UI plus external streams (see
  `AudioPlayerBloc`).
- State is one `Equatable` class with every field in `props`, a
  `<Feature>Status { initial, loading, ready, error }` enum when it loads async data (the player
  mirrors the engine with `PlayerStatus`), and, with an `errorMessage`,
  `copyWith(..., bool clearError = false)`. Never mutate the state or its lists.

## Errors
- Services and parsers throw `CabinaException` subtypes and keep the original as `cause`. `ApiClient`
  already maps http failures.
- Blocs and cubits: `on Object catch (error, stackTrace)` → `addError(error, stackTrace)` → emit
  `CabinaException.messageOf(error)` in `errorMessage`.
- A catch that drops data says why in the enclosing member's `///` (see
  `ItunesSearchService._tryParse`). Optional fields parse with `tryParse` and fall back to `null`.

## Reuse before writing
- Check `common/` (Project map) and `pubspec.yaml` before adding code or a package.
- Colors from `context.appTheme`, text styles from `AppTextStyles`.
- Rule of three: note the second copy in the plan's Out of scope, move it to `common/` at the third.

## Code rules
- Naming: `<X>Repository`, `<X>Service`, `<X>Parser`, `<X>Exception`. No `I` prefix.
- Every new public class gets a short `///` saying what it is for.
- User-facing text is hardcoded English. No l10n.
- No interfaces outside the repository rule, no pass-through wrappers, no parameters or branches for
  cases that don't exist yet, no unreachable fallbacks. Delete dead code.
- `_` for unused callback parameters.

## Tests
- Until a feature is refactored, add tests to its existing test file, even off the mirror path.
- Widget tests wrap in `MaterialApp(theme: AppTheme(isDark: false).toThemeData())`; there is no
  `pumpApp`.
- New or changed behaviour ships with a test that fails without the change.

## Ask before acting
Stop and ask, don't infer from general Flutter knowledge, before:
- adding a dependency;
- adding to `common/` or adding a `CabinaException` subtype;
- choosing Cubit vs Bloc, or app-scoped vs route-scoped, when the rules above don't settle it;
- changing a public contract that another feature uses;
- a decision that would set a convention this file doesn't cover;
- code that disagrees with this file in a way `docs/tasks/technical_debt.md` doesn't list.

## Workflow
- Every new feature or refactor, and any bug fix that touches more than one of view, cubit/bloc,
  repository and service, or more than one feature, starts with a plan in
  `docs/impl_plans/NN_<slug>.md` (NN = next free number) and waits for approval before code
  changes. The plan format:
  ```
  # NN · <Title>: <one-line outcome>

  **Priority/Effort:** P0–P3 · XS|S|M|L  **Depends on:** <plans or none>
  **Status:** draft | approved | applied
  **Commit draft(s):** one per independent step

  ## Problem          findings, each with file:line; debt items as technical_debt.md:line, no IDs
  ## Decisions        | Decision | Choice | Why |, when there is a choice to make
  ## Fix              per step: what changes; code only where the shape isn't obvious
  ## Files            new / moved / edited / deleted
  ## Tests first      GIVEN/WHEN/THEN names per test file, and what each pins
  ## Audit checklist  how the result should land on the staged-audit categories
  ## Out of scope     found but not done, and why
  ## Verify           gates, then a manual check on a device
  ```
- Never commit or push. Draft commit messages as `type(scope): <gitmoji> summary.`, e.g.
  `fix(search): 🐛 clear stale error on retry.`
- Before handing off, the gates are green. Never run `git add`: say the change is ready to stage, and
  once the user stages it, run `staged-audit`.
- A change to a feature also fixes that feature's open issues in `docs/tasks/technical_debt.md`
  when the fix stays inside the feature (no other feature's contract changes). An issue whose fix
  crosses features goes to the plan's Out of scope.
- When a change clears a Known debt row or changes the project map, update this file in the same
  change, and mark the issue ✅ or 🟡 in `docs/tasks/technical_debt.md`.
- Skills live in `.agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`; `.claude/skills` is a local symlink to it. There is
  no `CLAUDE.md`.
