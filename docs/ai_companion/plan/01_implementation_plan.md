# 01 · AI Companion: a sheet in the player with the synced transcript, a summary and chapters, prepared on demand and cached per device

**Priority/Effort:** P1 · L  **Depends on:** [`player/plan/01_implementation_plan.md`](../../player/plan/01_implementation_plan.md) (applied)
**Status:** draft
**Commit draft(s):**
1. `feat(show_detail): ✨ read the episode's RSS transcript link and pass the feed URL to the player.`
2. `feat(common): ✨ post JSON, upload files and download capped bytes through ApiClient.`
3. `feat(ai_companion): ✨ add the transcript, chapter and companion models with their parsers.`
4. `feat(ai_companion): ✨ prepare an episode with OpenAI and cache it complete.`
5. `feat(ai_companion): ✨ add AICompanionCubit, started only on demand.`
6. `feat(ai_companion): ✨ show the AI Companion sheet from the player.`
7. `docs(ai_companion): 📝 mark the sub-feature built.`

Behaviour is in [`../README.md`](../README.md) (H1–H3, E1–E13, US1–US7). This file is only the how.

## Problem
- `lib/player/views/player_page.dart:67-79`: the player column ends at `PlayerControls`. There is no
  entry point below the controls.
- `lib/show_detail/data/parsers/rss_feed_parser.dart:63-73` never reads `<podcast:transcript>`, and
  `lib/show_detail/models/episode.dart:5-13` has no field for it. Without it H2 and US5 can't exist.
- `lib/player/models/player_args.dart:6-10` carries no feed URL. A cache keyed by `guid` alone mixes
  two podcasts (E12), and `rss_feed_parser.dart:64` falls back to the title when there is no guid.
- `lib/common/network/api_client.dart:15` only does a GET that returns a string, with one 20 s
  timeout for everything (`api_client.dart:9`). The feature needs a JSON POST, a multipart upload
  and a byte download that stops at 25 MB, each with its own timeout.
- `lib/common/errors/exceptions.dart:20-44`: no exception can carry the companion's safe messages
  or say whether "Retry" applies (E1–E5, E7, E9).
- `lib/app/widgets/app_dependency_injection.dart:27-28`: `ApiClient` and `LocalStorage` are
  constructor fields captured in closures. Nothing below can read them, so a page-scoped feature
  can't build its own repository.
- Debt this change touches: `Episode` leaves `descriptionHtml` and `imageUrl` out of `props`
  (technical_debt.md:54); `ApiException.isRateLimited` is unused (technical_debt.md:79) and gets its
  first caller here.

| Whisper filter    | `WhisperTranscriptParser` drops a segment when `no_speech_prob > 0.6` and `avg_logprob < -1`, when `compression_ratio > 2.4`, or when it repeats the previous text.

Whisper filter note: OpenAI's Audio API reference gives the same `avg_logprob < -1` and
`compression_ratio > 2.4`, but says `no_speech_prob` "higher than 1.0", which a probability never
reaches. So the plan keeps 0.6, the default in the open-source Whisper code.

## Open questions
Each one is an "Ask before acting" item in AGENTS.md. All eight are answered; the choices are in
Decisions.
1. **Who creates the cubit.** AGENTS.md says route-scoped blocs are built in the page's `route()`,
   and also that the parent imports the sub-feature only for its entry widget. Both can't hold.
   **Answered:** the entry widget owns its `BlocProvider`. AGENTS.md (Layers and DI) now says so.
2. **`ApiClient` and `LocalStorage` readable from context.** Today `AppDependencyInjection` holds
   both as constructor fields and only hands them to the repositories it builds, so
   `context.read<ApiClient>()` fails anywhere below. `AICompanionButton` needs both to build its
   repository. **Answered:** two `RepositoryProvider.value` in `AppDependencyInjection`, one for
   each. `AICompanionRepository` is not registered app-scoped: that would copy a Known debt row.
3. **Additions to `common/`.** **Answered:** the two POSTs (`ApiClient.postJson`, `postMultipart`)
   `getBytes` (the capped audio download) and the `AICompanionException` subtype are approved.
4. **Contracts other features use.** `Episode.transcriptUrl` (optional) and `PlayerArgs.feedUrl`
   (required, one call site: `show_detail_page.dart:153`). **Answered:** approved. No other feature
   reads either field; `show_detail` only fills them in.
5. **Sub-feature importing a parent widget.** **Answered:** AGENTS.md (Layers and DI) now allows the
   parent's bloc, state, models and widgets, so the compact panel reuses `SeekBar`.
6. **UX the README doesn't settle.** **Answered:** Summary tab first, and follow pauses on a manual
   scroll.
7. **Where this plan lives.** **Answered:** every plan lives in
   `docs/<feature>/plan/NN_implementation_plan.md`, numbered per feature. AGENTS.md (Workflow)
   now says so, and the library and player plans moved with it.
8. **Request shapes.** **Answered:** confirmed against OpenAI's docs on Nov 10, 2026 (speech-to-text
   guide, Audio API reference, `gpt-5.6-luna` model page, reasoning and Structured Outputs guides).
   The shapes are under Step 4. Two things changed from the first draft:
   - The debrief uses the Responses API (`POST /v1/responses`), where the fields are
     `reasoning: {effort}` and `text: {format}`. `reasoning_effort` is the Chat Completions name.
   - The answer comes inside an envelope (`output[]` → `message` → `content[]`), and a refusal or an
     incomplete response doesn't follow the schema. `DebriefParser` reads the envelope.
   Not confirmed: the `gpt-5.6-luna` page lists Structured Outputs without naming strict mode, and
   the unit of `duration` isn't stated (segment `start`/`end` are in seconds). The first real call
   in step 4 settles both.

## Fix
**Step 1: feed data (show_detail, player args).**
- `Episode`: add `transcriptUrl` (`String?`), and put every field in `props`.
- `RssFeedParser._parseEpisode`: read `<podcast:transcript>` as in Decisions. Document the rule in
  the member's `///`.
- `PlayerArgs`: add `feedUrl`. `ShowDetailPage` passes `detail.feedUrl`.

**Step 2: common.**
- `ApiClient`:
  ```dart
  Future<String> postJson(Uri uri, {required Object body, Map<String, String>? headers, Duration? timeout});
  Future<String> postMultipart(Uri uri, {required Map<String, String> fields, required String fileField,
      required String fileName, required Uint8List bytes, Map<String, String>? headers, Duration? timeout});
  /// `null` when the body is larger than [maxBytes]; nothing past the limit is kept.
  Future<Uint8List?> getBytes(Uri uri, {required int maxBytes, Duration? timeout});
  ```
  One private helper holds the timeout and the failure mapping `getString` has today.
- `exceptions.dart`:
  ```dart
  /// AI Companion could not prepare an episode. [message] is safe to show:
  /// it never names the provider, the key or a limit.
  class AICompanionException extends CabinaException {
    const AICompanionException(super.message, {this.canRetry = false, super.cause});
    final bool canRetry;
  }
  ```
- `AppDependencyInjection`: `RepositoryProvider.value` for `apiClient` and `localStorage`.

**Step 3: models and parsers (pure Dart).**
- `TranscriptSegment { start, text, isMusic }`, `Chapter { title, segmentIndex }`,
  `TranscriptSource { rss, audio }`, `EpisodeCompanion { source, segments, transcribedDuration,
  summary, chapters }` with `indexAt` and `isSyncApproximate`. All three are `@JsonSerializable`
  with generated `fromJson`/`toJson`; `Duration` and the enum use the generator's defaults
  (microseconds, enum name). `schemaVersion` wraps the value in the repository, not in the model.
- `Transcript { source, segments, duration }`: what a transcript stage returns before the debrief.
  Not serialized.
- `SubtitleParser` (hand-written: SRT and VTT are text). `WhisperTranscriptParser` and
  `DebriefParser` decode with the generated `fromJson` of their response shapes, then apply the
  filter, music and chapter rules on typed fields. Each parser throws `FeedParseException` on a
  payload it can't read (`FormatException`, `CheckedFromJsonException`), with the original as
  `cause`.
- Run `fvm dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` after editing an annotated
  class.

**Step 4: services and repository.**
- `EpisodeDownloadService(apiClient)`: `fetchTranscript(url)` → text; `fetchAudio(url)` → bytes, or
  `null` over 25 MB. Timeouts: `fetchTranscript` keeps `ApiClient`'s 20 s default; `fetchAudio`
  passes `audioDownloadTimeout` (2 min), a named constant in the service, to `getBytes`.
- `OpenAIService(apiClient, apiKey)`: `isConfigured`, `transcribe(bytes, fileName)`,
  `debrief(segments)`. Timeouts: 5 min and 2 min. Both send `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.
  - `transcribe`: `POST https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions`, multipart, with `file`,
    `model=whisper-1` and `response_format=verbose_json`. Segment timestamps are the default, so
    `timestamp_granularities[]` isn't sent. The response has `duration`, `language`, `text` and
    `segments[]` (`start`, `end`, `text`, `avg_logprob`, `compression_ratio`, `no_speech_prob`).
    Accepted formats: mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, webm; any other enclosure is rejected by the
    API and lands on E7.
  - `debrief`: `POST https://api.openai.com/v1/responses`, JSON:
    ```json
    {
      "model": "gpt-5.6-luna",
      "reasoning": {"effort": "low"},
      "instructions": "<system prompt>",
      "input": "<JSON of [{id, text}]>",
      "text": {"format": {"type": "json_schema", "name": "debrief", "strict": true, "schema": {}}}
    }
    ```
    The schema's root is an object, every object sets `additionalProperties: false` and lists every
    property in `required`. `max_output_tokens` isn't set: reasoning tokens count against it.
  - `DebriefParser` reads the response envelope (`ResponsesEnvelope.fromJson`): the `output[]` item with `type: "message"`, then
    its `content[]` item with `type: "output_text"`, whose `text` is the schema JSON. A `refusal`
    content item, `status: "incomplete"` or no message item throws `FeedParseException` (E7).
- `AICompanionRepository`:
  ```dart
  Future<EpisodeCompanion?> loadCached(PlayerArgs args);   // null: none, corrupt or old version
  Future<Transcript> transcript(Episode episode);          // RSS first, else audio
  Future<EpisodeCompanion> debrief(Transcript transcript);
  Future<void> save(PlayerArgs args, EpisodeCompanion companion);
  ```
  `transcript` and `debrief` run inside one private `_guard` that applies the message table.

**Step 5: cubit.**
- `AICompanionState { status, companion, errorMessage, canRetry }` with
  `AICompanionStatus { initial, loading, ready, error }` and `copyWith(..., clearError)`.
- `AICompanionCubit({repository, args})`: `start()`, `retry()`, both over one private `_prepare()`
  with the AGENTS.md catch (`on Object` → `addError` → `messageOf`).

**Step 6: UI.**
- `AICompanionButton(args)`: provides the cubit, shows the "AI Companion" button with
  `Icons.auto_awesome`, opens the sheet and calls `start()`.
- `views/ai_companion_sheet.dart`: loading → `LoaderView`; error → `ErrorView(message, onRetry:
  canRetry ? retry : null)`; ready → tabs. Header, AI label, sync notice, compact panel at extent 1.
- `widgets/`: `summary_tab.dart` (summary + chapter rows with `start.clock`), `transcript_list.dart`,
  `compact_player_bar.dart`. Colors from `context.appTheme`, styles from `AppTextStyles`, times with
  `DurationFormat.clock`.
- `PlayerPage`: `AICompanionButton(args: widget.args)` under `PlayerControls`. Nothing else changes.

**Step 7: docs.**
- `AGENTS.md`: project map line for `ai_companion/` (drop "planned").
- `technical_debt.md`: line 54 → `Episode` done, `Podcast` open; line 79 without
  `ApiException.isRateLimited`.

## Tests first
Only tests for what a real episode, feed or provider response does. Every fixture is shaped like a
real payload: a real SRT/VTT snippet, a Whisper `verbose_json` and a Responses API body. Each README
row is pinned at one layer only. Not tested: generated `fromJson`/`toJson` field by field,
pass-throughs, `Equatable` boilerplate, the shared `LoaderView`/`ErrorView`, and Out of scope cases.

- GIVEN an item listing JSON, HTML and SRT transcripts THEN `transcriptUrl` is the SRT one. Pins
  US5 and the type rule.
- GIVEN an item with only an HTML transcript THEN `transcriptUrl` is null.

  repeated line and a 30 s gap THEN keeps only the spoken segments, with a music segment in the gap.
  Pins the filter and E13.
- GIVEN a response where every segment is filtered THEN returns no spoken segment. Pins E9's input.

`.../data/parsers/debrief_parser_test.dart`
- GIVEN a response with a reasoning item before the message, and chapters out of order with one
  unknown id THEN returns the summary and the known chapters sorted.

  Pins E7 for the debrief.

`.../models/episode_companion_test.dart`
- GIVEN positions before the first sentence, inside one and inside a music section THEN `indexAt`
  returns 0, that sentence and the music segment. Pins US1.

- GIVEN an RSS source that ends 30 s before the total (an outro with no cues) THEN sync is not
  approximate.
- GIVEN a companion WHEN `toJson` then `fromJson` THEN it is equal. Pins the generator config
  (`Duration`, enum, nested lists) the cache relies on.

`.../data/services/open_ai_service_test.dart` (mocked `ApiClient`)
- WHEN transcribe THEN posts multipart to `/v1/audio/transcriptions` with the bearer key,
  `whisper-1`, `verbose_json`, the file name and the 5 min timeout.
- WHEN debrief THEN posts JSON to `/v1/responses` with the bearer key, `gpt-5.6-luna`, effort
  low, the strict schema, only `{id, text}` of spoken segments, and the 2 min timeout.

`.../data/services/episode_download_service_test.dart` (mocked `ApiClient`)
- WHEN fetchAudio THEN calls `getBytes` with the 25 MB cap and `audioDownloadTimeout`. Pins E4's
  limit.

`.../data/ai_companion_repository_test.dart` (mocked services and `LocalStorage`)

- GIVEN a retryable failure WHEN retry THEN emits loading without the error, then ready. Pins US6.

`test/player/ai_companion/widgets/ai_companion_button_test.dart` and
`views/ai_companion_sheet_test.dart` (`MockBloc`, `MockCubit`,
`MaterialApp(theme: AppTheme(isDark: false).toThemeData())`)

## Audit checklist
- Defensive Programming: every provider payload parsed at the edge; a closed cubit neither calls
  nor saves; corrupt cache reads as none; `getBytes` never holds more than the cap.
- TDD: each README row (H, E, US) pinned once, at the lowest layer that owns it; real-shaped
  fixtures; no test of generated code or pass-throughs. Parsers and cubit written test-first.
- Clean Code: `///` on every public class; one message table, one place.
- Feature First: everything under `lib/player/ai_companion/`; `player/` imports one widget;
  `show_detail` only gains a field.
- KISS: no isolate, no new package, no interface, no partial state; JSON through the generator
  already in `pubspec.yaml`, no hand-written casts.
- VGV Principles: analysis clean; colors and text styles from the theme.
- Repository principles: View → Cubit → Repository → Service; raw JSON never leaves `data/`.
- Scalability: a new provider replaces `OpenAIService`; a new transcript format is one parser.
- DRY: `SeekBar`, `ErrorView`, `LoaderView`, `DurationFormat.clock`, `LocalStorage`, `ApiClient`
  reused.

## Out of scope
- Aborting the request in flight when the player closes: needs `http`'s abortable requests through
  `ApiClient`. Today at most one call is wasted.
- Cache size and eviction: transcripts live in `shared_preferences`, which loads everything at
  start. Fine for a review; a file per episode needs `path_provider`, a new dependency.
- Isolates for parsing: revisit if a parse measures over one frame on a mid-range phone.
- Audio over 25 MB, partial results, background work, shared cache, ads, metrics, other transcript
  formats: README "What's left out of the MVP".
- App-wide player and `audio_session` (technical_debt.md:8, technical_debt.md:18): cross-feature.
- `state.extra!` (technical_debt.md:48) and `PlayerArgs` living in `player/` (technical_debt.md:67):
  shared with `show_detail`.
- The key ships inside the binary: accepted in the README; production keeps it on a server.

## Verify
- `fvm dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` when an annotated class changed,
  then `fvm flutter analyze`, `fvm dart format --set-exit-if-changed .`, `fvm flutter test`, after
  every step.
- Device, with `fvm flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env`: the four paths of the README's "How
